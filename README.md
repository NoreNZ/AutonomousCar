# AutonomousCar
Self-driving car AI using neural network.
Utilizes NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies).
Combines basic neural network with an evolutionary algorithm to autonomously train the neural network.

Four 'maps' are available.
Switching between maps will retain neural network weights.
Game speed and other controls are available.
